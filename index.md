# Quotes on Offensive AI: Automating manual, tedious and repetitive red teaming tasks

> Machine learning can aid with passive recon, initial intrusion, C2 traffic, privilege escalation, internal recon, and lateral movement, says Max Heinemayer (Darktrace)

“It's already not a fair game. The defenders are losing, and have been losing for the last 30 years,” says Heinemayer [Darktrace Director of Threat Hunting Max Heinemayer]
```

```
“A lot of what hackers do is quite manual, tedious, and repetitive. And these are the bits that offensive AI can automate speed up,” Heinemeyer says. “And not only that, but existing attackers can scale up their attacks.”
```

> The term ‘offensive AI’ describes the use of specific AI and machine learning algorithms to make cybercriminals more productive, efficient, and difficult to detect.  

```
“When I say offensive AI, I mean machine learning algorithms either supervised or unsupervised, [like] deep learning and reinforcement learning being used to augment today's cyberattacks,” says Heinemeyer.

Modern machine learning technologies can be widely used to improve the effectiveness of cyberattacks throughout the attack life cycle, according to Heinemeyer.

“[This includes] any piece of the attack life-cycle: initial reconnaissance, initial intrusion, command-and-control traffic, privilege escalation, internal reconnaissance, lateral movement. Any of these could be augmented by machine learning in one way or another.”
```

```
“What we also know is that the legacy approach can't keep up. Because legacy tools are always retrospective. They are static and they are siloed. Mark my words: Solar Winds was the death knell for first-generation security tools,” he says.
```

> The answer, according to Heinemeyer, is to fight fire with fire – or more specifically, AI with AI.
“For detection, we use unsupervised machine learning…”
